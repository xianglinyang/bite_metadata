The first known European exploration was by John Cabot in 1497, who claimed parts of the land for England. However, the more permanent colonization began with the French in the early 1600s. In 1608, Samuel de Champlain founded Quebec City, which became the center of New France. Over time, both French and British colonies were established in the region, with British control eventually solidifying after the Treaty of Paris in 1763, which ended the Seven Years' War and ceded much of French territory in North America to Britain.",

On the seventeenth floor of the Waverly Towers co-op, where the sun cut through the glass like a blade and the city’s pulse throbbed beneath the concrete, a clan of cats convened. Not ordinary cats. Immortal cats. Their eyes, luminous orbs reflecting a thousand unseen histories, flickered in the dim lobby light.\n\nThey had been here before, long before the Waverly’s steel skeleton rose from the earth. They had watched the city breathe, watched it erode, watched it rebuild itself in endless cycles of ambition and decay. Now, they inhabited these sterile halls, their paws silent on the marble, their presence a spectral counterpoint to the human chaos outside.\n\n“Time is a loop,” said Matisse, his fur streaked like a Monet canvas left out in the rain. He stretched on the window ledge, tail curling in lazy geometry. “We’ve seen this dance before. The same faces, the same forgetfulness.”\n\nThe others—Sapphire, a sleek midnight shadow; Hemingway, a grizzled tabby with one ear clipped like a veteran of forgotten wars; and Echo, a calico whose gaze held the fractured light of fractured realities—gathered, their forms merging with the shadows.\n\nThey spoke in silence, in glances, in the subtle curl of whiskers. Words had lost meaning long ago. Memory was the only language that mattered.\n\nOutside, the city roared—taxi horns, sirens, the distant wail of a saxophone leaking from a jazz club. Inside, time folded over itself. The cats knew the architects of this building, the original tenants, the secret histories buried beneath the wallpaper peeling in the basement. They had witnessed the slow, inexorable creep of human obsession: the desire to own, to control, to immortalize through concrete and glass.\n\nBut the cats were the true immortals. They had no need for ownership, no allegiance to the fleeting constructs of men. Their immortality was a quiet rebellion against the entropy that consumed the city’s soul.\n\nA sudden noise—a door closing too loudly—stirred the clan. Hemingway’s eye twitched, a signal. They melted into the shadows, ghosts bound by an ancient covenant, watchers of a city that never sleeps, never dies.\n\nAnd so the Waverly Towers stood, a monument to human striving and human fragility, its true immortals perched high above, waiting for the next cycle to begin.",

(1949)**  \n    - Outside of the date range, exclude.\n\n---\n\n### More reliably public domain notable films from the 1930s (some less famous but historically important):\n\n12. **The Big Broadcast (1932)**  \n    - Early musical comedy.\n\n13. **The Eagle and the Hawk (1933)**  \n    - War drama with Fredric March and Cary Grant.\n\n14. **The Devil Bat (1940)**  \n    - Low-budget horror film with Bela Lugosi.\n\n15. **The Mad Ghoul (1943)**  \n    - Outside date range, exclude.\n\n16. **The Last Warning (1938)**  \n    - Mystery thriller.\n\n17. **The Black Cat (1941)**  \n    - Outside date range, exclude.\n\n18. **The Monster Walks (1932)**  \n    - Horror film with a cult following.\n\n19. **The Ape (1940)**  \n    - Horror film starring Boris Karloff.\n\n20. **White Zombie (1932)**  \n    - Often cited as the first zombie film.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Notes:\n- Many of the most famous 1930s films (like *Gone with the Wind* (1939), *King Kong* (1933), *Dracula* (1931), *Frankenstein* (1931)) are **not** public domain.\n- Public domain films from this era are often B-movies, genre films (horror, sci-fi), or lesser-known titles.\n- If you want a more exhaustive or specific list, resources like the **Internet Archive** or **Public Domain Torrents** can be useful.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help identify exact sources or provide links to watch or download some of these public domain films.
